    Why? because i want to share it without having a public website

    How:
    1. User puts in search categories in html and triggers JS via "search"
    2. JS filters an 2d-array (1st for anime list, 2nd for infos for each one)
      and constructs a html-code string for a table
    3. JS edits the html and puts the generated html-code into the "table" div

    i intend to let users view it without downloading using
      https://htmlpreview.github.io/<git-hub-html-file link (with slashes)>

    @Contributors: please dont add H* disguising itself as normal and avoid spoilers

      <summary>Infos about this Project</summary>
      <p>I've made this to help you find mangas in this genre (since there aren't too many and not all of them are on MyAnimeList, etc).</p>
      <p>I hope to be able to continue, improve and exapnd this, but i can't guarantee anything</p>
      <p>Why do i use AMAB and AFAB instead of boy and girl? i can't always remember (or want to spoil) wheater the characters stay cis (in a wrong body) or change. Also it hopefully avoids a lot of confusion.</p>

		This is meant to be a single file (therefore everything si crammed in here), which
		can be used on any device without anything external (therefore no php, etc).
		Why? because i want to share it without having a public website

		How:
		1. User puts in search categories in html and triggers JS via "search"
		2. JS filters an 2d-array (1st for anime list, 2nd for infos for each one)
			and constructs a html-code string for a table
		3. JS edits the html and puts the generated html-code into the "table" div

		i intend to let users view it without downloading using
			https://htmlpreview.github.io/<git-hub-html-file link (with slashes)>

		@Contributors: please dont add H* disguising itself as normal and avoid spoilers

		<details>
			<summary>Infos about this Project</summary>
			<p>I've made this to help you find mangas in this genre (since there aren't too many and not all of them are on MyAnimeList, etc).</p>
			<p>I hope to be able to continue, improve and exapnd this, but i can't guarantee anything</p>
			<p>Why do i use AMAB and AFAB instead of boy and girl? i can't always remember (or want to spoil) wheater the characters stay cis (in a wrong body) or change. Also it hopefully avoids a lot of confusion.</p>

			<p>I don't get paid for this or get any other benefit, theese are just products i personally like to use</p>
			<h4>Free Android offline Manga Reader without Ads:</h4>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi">Tachiyomi</a> - it is free, open source, ad-free , can download mangas, has all mangas in this list and has a lot of quality of life features (like lower brightness, auto-cropping, splitting pages, color-correction, night mode, etc).</p>

			<p>OpenVPN has many implimentations for almost every device. Its free and OpenSource. Youll have to find the servers yourself, but you can easily find lists with google. <a href="https://www.vpngate.net/en/">A server list</a>. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&hl=en&gl=US">An android version</a></p>
